# Monte Carlo Simulation of Photon Transport in a NaI Scintillation Detector

This project simulates gamma photon transport using a Monte Carlo method within a cylindrical Sodium Iodide (NaI) scintillation detector. The goal is to generate realistic gamma-ray spectra and calculate detector efficiencies by simulating individual photon interactions based on physical cross sections.

## Simulation Background

Monoenergetic gamma photons emitted isotropically from a point source are simulated as they interact with a NaI scintillation detector. The simulation tracks these photons as they undergo physical processes such as:

- **Photoelectric absorption**  
- **Compton scattering**  
- **Pair production**

These interactions are probabilistically sampled using cross-section data from the **NIST XCOM** database. The trajectory of each photon is updated step-by-step until absorption or escape. Energy deposited by interactions is recorded in a histogram to generate a gamma-ray spectrum, smoothed using a Gaussian detector resolution model.

The final gamma-ray spectrum represents energy deposited within the detector and includes features like:

- **Photopeaks** (full absorption)  
- **Compton continua** (partial energy deposition)  
- **Escape peaks** (for pair production)
